# CodeSandboxer

This project was recently divided, and you are probably looking for straight [react-codesandboxer](/packages/react-codesandboxer/CHANGELOG.md), however to make this meet more use-cases, [codesandboxer](/packages/codesandboxer/CHANGELOG.md) now lives as its own package that can be used in different contexts.
